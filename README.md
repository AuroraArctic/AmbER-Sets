**AmbER** (**Amb**igiuous **E**ntity **R**etrieval) sets are collections of queries which individually test a retriever's ability to do entity disambiguation.
Each AmbER set contains queries about entities which share a name. 
See our [**ACL 2021 paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06830) for more details on the motivation behind AmbER sets.
